          We are primarily a research group based in the Newcastle Business
          School and the University of Newcastle (UON), focusing on issues
          related to decision-making and policy-making in healthcare. In order
          to create value across the whole system, we need people researching
          and practicing across all these different levels. Therefore, our team
          not only includes classical (health) economic experts, but also
          researchers from public and allied health, social science, psychology
          and more. Our members include staff and students of the University of
          Newcastle across the Faculties of Business and Law, but also Health
          and Medicine, Arts and Humanities, Science, and Engineering and Built
          Environment and we welcome new members from all Faculties and Schools.
          Our membership is also not exclusive to UON and we have both local and
          global members from other Universities, research institutions and
          industries. See contact information below. Although our group is
          composed mostly of academics, the research and industry experience of
          our members covers a wide range of areas, as indicated by the breadth
          of schools and faculties our members are from.

          As a group we will identify inefficiencies within the current
          healthcare system, by examining the literature and coordinating with
          healthcare stakeholders, to provide sustainable, value-based
          assessments of health interventions and policies. We do this by
          investigating not only the costs and benefits but also the
          decision-making processes of all involved; healthcare practitioners,
          patients and policy makers. This stakeholder engagement will be
          facilitated through the organisation and development of workshops,
          seminars, and educational programmes for both students and external
          stakeholders, such as members from our local and nearby health
          districts. These programmes will occur in conjunction with a number of
          group driven research projects to improve our understanding of health
          related issues and policy implementation.

          To improve effectiveness and efficiency across multiple stakeholder

        <p>
          To draw and extend upon the existing research and policies of value
          based healthcare by fostering a collaborative, multi-disciplinary,
          local-global environment which encourages novel strategies to address
          real world health problems by maximising the skills, expertise and
          resources of the university and its affiliates, and creates lasting
          positive impact.
