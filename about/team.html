                    <p>
                      I have worked at the University of Newcastle since 2015 as
                      a casual academic and research assistant within Psychology
                      and now in 2019 as a post-doctoral research fellow within
                      health economics. My research uses and develops techniques
                      from cognitive, mathematical and computational psychology
                      as well as health economics to improve measurement of
                      cognition, decision making and preferences. In particular
                      my thesis explores cognitive deficits in people with
                      schizophrenia through the linear ballistic accumulator
                      (LBA) model of decision making. I have also collaborated
                      on a number of projects examining consumer preferences in
                      oncology care through discrete choice experiments (DCE). I
                      am currently interested in more closely marrying the
                      fields of psychology and health economics to establish
                      optimal measurement of patient and consumer preferences to
                      provide more value based healthcare.
